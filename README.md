# Java Programs Repository ☕💻  

Hey there! 👋  
I’m a student currently pursuing **B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning (AI-ML)** 🤖✨.  

This repository is my personal collection of **Java programs**, starting right from **Chapter 1** of my Java course. 📚  
Think of it as my coding diary 📝 — where I practice, experiment, and upload all the programs I write during my learning journey.  

So if you’re also a beginner in Java, feel free to explore this repo! 🚀  
Who knows? My homework might just save yours 😉

## 📂 Repository Structure
Each program is neatly saved as a `.java` file and named after its topic.
and each program has a short description so it is helpful

✨ More programs coming soon...
